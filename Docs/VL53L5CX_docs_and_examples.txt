Arduino library for VL53L5CX.  Includes example for motion indicator use.  The little that I could see
in here is that motion indication does not seem to report where motion is; it only says that there is motion, hence
you might only want to read out data when motion is sensed.  It also has an example for multiple targets per zone, 
albeit I didn't find the example code to be very informative.
