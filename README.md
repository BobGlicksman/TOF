# TOF
Use a VL53L5CX 8x8 time of flight sensor to sense the presense of a person and their movement through the the sensor's field of view.

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROCESS AT THIS TIME

## The sensor is a Sparkfun Qwiic TOF module, p/n SEN-18642. 
The sensor is connected to a Particle Photon using a Qwiic to male pin cable, as follows:

Qwiic BLACK wire to Photon GND

Qwicc RED wire to Photon 3.3v

Qwicc BLUE wire to Photon D0 (I2C SDA)

Qwiic YELLOW wire to Photon D1 (I2C SCL)
